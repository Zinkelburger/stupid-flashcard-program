"Traditional 3-Tier Architecture Layers","Access, Distribution, and Core."
"Spine-Leaf Architecture Components","Spine switches (backbone) and Leaf switches (endpoint connection)."
"Primary Traffic Flow in 3-Tier Networks","North-South traffic (from user to the internet/WAN)."
"Primary Traffic Flow in Spine-Leaf Networks","East-West traffic (server-to-server within the data center)."
"Loop Prevention in 3-Tier Architecture","Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which blocks redundant paths."
"Pathing Protocol in Spine-Leaf Architecture","Equal-Cost Multi-Pathing (ECMP), which allows all connections to be active."
"Typical Use Case for 3-Tier Architecture","Enterprise campus networks."
"Typical Use Case for Spine-Leaf Architecture","Modern data centers and cloud environments."
"Latency and Predictability in Spine-Leaf","Low and predictable, as traffic is always a maximum of two hops away (leaf-spine-leaf)."
"How to Scale a Spine-Leaf Network","Add more Leaf switches for more endpoints or more Spine switches for more bandwidth."
"Role of the Access Layer (3-Tier)","Connects end-user devices (computers, phones, printers) to the network."
"Role of the Distribution Layer (3-Tier)","Aggregates traffic from the Access layer and enforces policies."
"Role of the Core Layer (3-Tier)","Provides a high-speed backbone for traffic between Distribution layer devices."
"Role of Leaf Switches (Spine-Leaf)","Connect to endpoints like servers and storage. Every Leaf switch connects to every Spine switch."
"Role of Spine Switches (Spine-Leaf)","Acts as the network backbone, connecting all Leaf switches. Spine switches do not connect to each other."
"Which architecture is typically a Layer 3 routed fabric?","Spine-Leaf, which uses routing protocols to manage paths and avoid loops."
"Disadvantage of STP in 3-Tier Networks","It puts expensive, redundant links in a blocking state, wasting available bandwidth."
"Device that connects to servers in a Spine-Leaf model","The Leaf switch."
"Network design focused on high availability and performance for data centers","Spine-Leaf."
"Network design common in traditional corporate environments","3-Tier Hierarchical."
"The meaning of 'non-blocking' in a Spine-Leaf fabric","There is enough bandwidth from the Leaf switches to the Spine to handle all traffic from the endpoints simultaneously."
"Latency and Hops in 3-Tier Architecture","Can be unpredictable and vary depending on the traffic path through the Access, Distribution, and Core layers."
"Connectivity Rule for Leaf Switches","Leaf switches connect to endpoints and to every Spine switch, but never to other Leaf switches."
"Connectivity Rule for Spine Switches","Spine switches only connect to Leaf switches; they never connect to other Spine switches."
"Key Advantage of Spine-Leaf over 3-Tier for Data Centers","Optimized for East-West traffic with predictable low latency and high scalability."
