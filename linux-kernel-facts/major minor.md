The major and minor device numbers are related to one another as illustrated in ``Major and minor numbers''. A given software driver can be working with one or more hardware controllers, each of which has its own major number. Each device connected to a given controller then would have its own minor number. Thus, any single device can be identified through the major/minor number combination.
