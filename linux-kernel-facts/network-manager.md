In networking, an "unmanaged" interface is like a telephone that is plugged into the wall but has no service plan. The hardware is there, and the electricity is running through it, but no one has told it what its phone number is or how to route calls.

In your specific case, NetworkManager is the "service provider" for your Linux system. When an interface is unmanaged, it means NetworkManager has explicitly decided (or been told) to ignore that device.
